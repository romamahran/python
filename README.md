This Python program uses object-oriented programming (OOP) and threading to analyze stock prices efficiently. It defines two classes: StockThread, which inherits from threading.Thread and handles the profit calculation for a single stock in its own thread, and StockApp, which manages all the stocks and threads. The program first generates random price data for 10 stocks (each with 7 daily prices) and then starts a separate thread for each stock to compute the maximum profit based on price increases from one day to the next. After all threads finish, it collects and compares the profits to determine which stock had the highest return. This approach showcases OOP principles like encapsulation and inheritance, while also demonstrating real-world parallel processing using threads to simulate a trading platform analyzing multiple stocks simultaneously.
